Dear PT Suitmedia Kreasi Indonesia,

I hope this message finds you well.
I would like to extend my sincere apologies for uploading the project repository to GitHub instead of GitLab, as per the company’s standard procedure.This decision was made because I encountered technical difficulties on GitLab, where I was unable to change the repository’s visibility to public access. After several attempts to resolve the issue, I opted to use GitHub to ensure that the project could be publicly accessed as required for the team or other stakeholders.
Please rest assured that I have no intention of disregarding the company’s policies. This step was taken solely to maintain the workflow and meet project requirements.
Moving forward, I will take extra precautions and strive to resolve similar issues in a manner fully aligned with company guidelines. Should you require the repository to be transferred back to GitLab, I am more than willing to comply and take necessary corrective actions.
Thank you for your understanding and guidance. I apologize for any inconvenience caused by my actions.

Best regards,
Niqo Zuriyat Ramadhana
